/* Post-build: give every known app route a real static index.html, so GitHub
 * Pages serves it with HTTP 200.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Without it, GitHub Pages has no file at /sign-up and falls back to 404.html.
 * That page *renders* — it stashes the path in sessionStorage and bounces to
 * "/" where main.tsx restores it — so a human sees the right screen and nothing
 * looks broken. But the HTTP status is **404**.
 *
 * Every LP CTA points at app.<domain>/sign-up. A 404 status on the signup
 * destination fails Google Ads destination checks, and tells every crawler the
 * page does not exist.
 *
 * ⚠️ Measured 2026-08-23: app.dragonreply.ai, app.dragonrefunds.com and
 * app.dragonrestock.com ALL return 404 on /sign-up. This is an estate-wide
 * defect, not a quirk of this repo — the sibling repos need the same fix.
 *
 * 404.html stays for genuinely unknown paths, where a 404 is correct.
