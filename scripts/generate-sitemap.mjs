/* Post-build step 3: emit dist/sitemap.xml from the routes that were actually
 * built.
 *
 * ── Why generated, never hand-written ────────────────────────────────────
 * A static public/sitemap.xml goes stale the moment someone adds a route. This
 * derives the URL list from dist/ — every directory holding an index.html — so
 * the sitemap and the prerender cannot drift apart.
 *
 * ── Conventions ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * • URLs carry a trailing slash, matching the <link rel="canonical"> that
 *   postbuild-spa-routes.mjs writes. A sitemap URL that disagrees with the
 *   page's own canonical is a wasted crawl.
 * • lastmod is the build date — these are pages redeployed on every content
 *   change, so build date is the honest signal.
 * • Nothing here invents URLs: if it isn't in dist/, it isn't in the sitemap.
 *
 * ── 🔜 Published seller profiles ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * WaitHowMuch' whole point is that a published profile is publicly
 * reachable — by search engines AND by AI assistants. Profiles are dynamic and
 * live behind the backend, so they cannot come from a dist/ walk. When the
 * profile backend lands, add a SECOND sitemap generated from the profile list
 * (e.g. dist/sitemap-profiles.xml) and reference both from a sitemap index; do
 * NOT try to bolt profiles onto this file's directory walk. public/llms.txt
 * needs the matching pointer at the same time.
