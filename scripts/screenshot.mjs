/* Screenshot the app's real pages with the API stubbed.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every page worth looking at is behind auth and behind a backend, so there is
 * no way to SEE this app without either logging in against production or
 * standing the whole stack up locally. That meant UI defects shipped unseen —
 * and two were found the first time this ran:
 *
 *   1. `globals.css` defined only --background and --foreground, while the
 *      shared package's components are built against ten CSS variables. Every
 *      <Button> resolved to `background: ` — no surface at all, so "Sign in"
 *      rendered as bare text. Nothing errored.
 *   2. The shared <Input> hardcodes `bg-white` and sets no text colour, so in
 *      dark mode the value inherited near-white ON white: ~1.1:1, i.e. what you
 *      type is invisible. Placeholders looked fine, which is how it survived.
 *
 * Neither is visible in source review, and neither throws. Look at the pages.
 *
 * ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   npm run build && node scripts/screenshot.mjs [--light] [--out DIR]
 *
 * Requires Chrome (CHROME_PATH, or the usual per-platform locations).
 * Output is gitignored — these are for looking at, not for committing.
