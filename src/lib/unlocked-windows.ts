// THE WINDOW GATE — which windows a reader has earned.
//
// Longer windows are for readers who have shown their own numbers: you
// publish, you see. A visitor with no connection gets 30 days; picking a
// locked one opens the dialog that would earn it.
//
// 🚨 ONE COPY, because the founder profile and the business page both ask.
// It lived inline in pages/PublicProfile.tsx while /business/:slug had no
// picker at all; the moment the business page got one, two copies of a
// PRICING rule would have been two places to change it and one place to
// forget. The shared package cannot own this — it renders public data for
// crawlers and is deliberately session-free, so the host resolves the gate
// and passes the answer.

 *   2  at least one connection with a COMPLETE valuation → the deep-dives
 *
 * The rule is the same one all the way up: you see what you show. Connecting
 * an account buys the long windows; finishing your own questionnaire buys
 * other people's deep-dives.
 *
 * 🚨 Tier 2 is a PROMPT, not a permission. The deep-dive text itself never
 * comes down to a locked reader — the public payload carries two sentences
 * and the rest lives behind GET /v1/businesses/:slug/deep-dive, which checks
 * the same rule server-side. What this hook decides is which CTA to show, so
 * getting it wrong shows the wrong invitation, never the wrong content.
