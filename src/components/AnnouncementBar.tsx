/**
 * Site-wide anonymity notice.
 *
 * Rendered by <Shell>, so it appears on every page including public profiles —
 * which is the point. The people who most need to read it are sellers landing
 * cold on someone else's profile, wondering what publishing their own numbers
 * would expose about them.
 *
 * Dismissible, and the dismissal sticks per browser. First-time visitors — the
 * audience this is written for — still always see it; only people who have read
 * it and closed it get it out of the way.
 *
 * 🔑 The key is versioned (`…_v2`). If the wording ever changes materially,
 * bump it so people who dismissed the old notice are shown the new one instead
 * of having it silently suppressed forever.
 *
 * v1 → v2: the notice went from "no brand-identifying information" to naming
 * the fear it is actually answering — that publishing your numbers hands a
 * competitor a map — and added that the niche is not revealed either. That is
 * a bigger promise than v1 made, so anyone who dismissed v1 has not read it.
 *
 * Coloured with --verified-tint / --verified rather than a warning palette:
 * this is reassurance, not a caution. 6.0:1, per the token comment in
 * globals.css.
