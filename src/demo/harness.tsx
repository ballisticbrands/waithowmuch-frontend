/**
 * The seam every demo page is built on.
 *
 * ── Why a fetch seam rather than a prop ──────────────────────────────────
 * The pages a demo wants to show — `PublicProfilePage`, `Leaderboard` — take
 * an identity and fetch; none of them takes a data prop, and the state-free
 * bodies underneath are deliberately not exported ("a seam, not API"). Rather
 * than reimplement a layout — which would drift from the real page the first
 * time either changed — a demo answers the one request the page makes. What
 * renders IS the production component, so a demo is always a truthful picture
 * of the page.
 *
 * This lives here rather than inside one demo page because the ordering and
 * lifecycle rules below are subtle, were learned the hard way, and a second
 * copy of them is a second chance to get them wrong.
