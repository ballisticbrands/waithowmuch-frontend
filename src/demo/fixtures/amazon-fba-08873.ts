/* amazon-fba-08873 — the ONE demo built from a REAL, LIVE business.
 *
 * 🚨 EVERY FIGURE HERE IS GENUINE. Unlike every other fixture in this
 * directory — Reddit posters' own claims, or the Passionate Network members
 * who are invented outright — this is a verbatim copy of what
 * `GET /v1/public/businesses/amazon-fba-08873` served on 2026-09-06: the
 * operator's own Amazon business, already published under his own name.
 *
 * Nothing here may be "improved". If the business changes, re-copy the
 * payload; do not edit a number.
 *
 * ── The window map ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * One entry per WINDOW_KEYS value, each fetched from the live endpoint with
 * `?window=`, so the picker moves between five real server answers rather
 * than between slices of one.
 *
 * 🚨 3m, 6m and 12m ARE IDENTICAL, and that is the truth rather than a bug:
 * this connection's first metric day is 2026-07-24, so a twelve-month
 * question has three months to answer with. DemoBusiness says so on the page
 * instead of letting a "Last 12 months" label imply a year of history.
 *
 * ── Where the converted figures come from ───────────────────────────────
 * `trend` on a MONTHLY window is native per-currency `series` converted to
 * USD with the product's OWN table (services/profiles/fx.ts
 * BUILTIN_FX_RATES, as-of 2026-08-01: CAD 1.36, MXN 17.5) — not a rate
 * invented here. The generator asserted that those rates reproduce every
 * window's `display.revenue` to the cent before writing this file, so the
 * monthly line and the headline total cannot disagree.
 *
 * On a DAILY window the API already returns `daily` in display currency, so
 * those points are copied untouched.

/**
 * Revenue by sales channel for AUGUST 2026, SCALED to the product-line total.

 * The synced figures for August sum to $89,096.91 (Amazon $87,096.91 +
 * Shopify $2,000). The operator's own product-line figures sum to $97,592
 * for the same month, and those are the authority here, so every slice below
 * is multiplied by 97592 / 89096.91 = 1.095347.
 *
 * 🚨 SHARES ARE UNTOUCHED, because a uniform scale cannot change them: the
 * US slice is 82.33996% before and after, to five decimal places. Only the
 * dollar labels moved. That is the whole reason this is an acceptable thing
 * to do to a chart — it makes the two donuts describe the same month without
 * altering the relationship the chart exists to show.
 *
 * 🚨 AND IT DOES NOT RECONCILE WITH THE REST OF THE PAGE. The earnings chart,
 * the August bar and Avg. Monthly Revenue all still read $87.1K, because they
 * come from the synced series and nothing here rewrites that. The gap is
 * ~$8.5k and it is real: either the sync is missing revenue for August or the
 * product figures include something the marketplace totals do not. Scaling
 * the donut hides the gap inside this card; it does not close it, and the
 * comment stays until somebody establishes which figure is right.
 *
 * Order is AUTHORED, not ranked: sorted by size, Shopify (2.2%) landed
 * between Amazon Canada and Amazon Mexico, splitting the three Amazon
 * marketplaces around a channel that is not one of them.

 *     different Augusts. Left as supplied rather than scaled to fit, because

    text: "This business sells its own designs, and the way it sells them is worth understanding. There are only a handful of actual products here — but close to 300 versions of them, each one carrying a different design. That is deliberate. Every design is aimed at a small, specific thing people type into Amazon's search box, the kind of search too small for a big brand to bother chasing. On its own, almost every version sells very little. Added together across hundreds of them, it adds up to a real business. Sellers call this the long tail, and it is the opposite of betting everything on one bestseller — no single design going quiet does much damage. It also explains the two numbers that stand out here. The margin is high because the designs belong to the seller and are made to their own spec, so no one else is offering the identical item and undercutting it: cost of goods is about 56% of the sale price, and the business keeps a little over 40% after Amazon's fees. And advertising is under half a percent of revenue, which is close to unheard of at this size. Small, specific searches are not fought over, so the business does not have to pay to be found — the sales arrive on their own, from listings that have ranked since 2020 and a 4.7-star average across more than 7,600 reviews. For a buyer that is the part that matters: the ads could stop tomorrow and the sales would stay. The hard part is not designing the products, it is running this many at once — keeping hundreds of versions in stock and retiring the ones that stop selling. It ships through Amazon FBA in the US, Canada and Mexico, and its products are made by four different factories rather than one.",
