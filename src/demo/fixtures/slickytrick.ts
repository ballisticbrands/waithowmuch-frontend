/* Demo fixture: a UK wholesale seller finishing his first FBA year.
 *
 * Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFBA/comments/1w2012e/coming_up_on_my_1st_year_fba_in_the_uk/
 * (posted 2026-08-29), plus the Seller Central screenshot attached to it.
 *
 * ── Where each figure came from ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * REVENUE is not in the post body. It is read off the screenshot's header:
 * "Product sales — 231.8K GBP — Aug 1, 2025 to today". Amazon renders that
 * tile to one decimal of a thousand, so £231,800 is HIS number at HIS
 * precision — not a figure anyone here refined.
 *
 * PROFIT is the low end of a self-declared range. His words: "I estimate
 * that after all expenses that there will be about £12-£15,000 pure profit."
 * That is an estimate made days BEFORE his first Ltd tax return is filed —
 * not a Sellerboard payout, not a settled number — so the range is reduced
 * to its conservative end, £12,000, and both facts are stated in `notes` and
 * in the on-page `margin_note`.
 *
 * ── The period is 394 days, not 30 and not 365 ───────────────────────────
 * The screenshot covers 2025-08-01 → 2026-08-29 inclusive = 394 days. Every
 * 30-day number below is that period scaled by 30/394, stated because
 * "interpolated from just over 13 months" and "measured over 30 days" are
 * different claims and this page renders the second while meaning the first.
 *
 *   sales      231,800.00 → 17,649.75
 *   net profit  12,000.00 →    913.71
 *   margin = net profit / sales = 12,000 / 231,800 = 5.2%
 *
 * ── What he did NOT publish, and is therefore absent ─────────────────────
 * Fees, ad spend, COGS, units, orders, SKU count, brand count and category
 * are all null or hidden. He posted no payout figure, so the template's
 * `cogs = payout − net profit` identity has nothing to stand on. The
 * screenshot's "Units Ordered 157" and "Open Orders 127" are TODAY-ONLY
 * tiles from his single best month — multiplying either into a 30-day total
 * would be inventing a number, so units/orders stay at 0 (the payload types
 * them non-null; the profile page renders neither).
 *
 * 🚧 His "35% ROI consistently" is a SOURCING return on cost over the last
 * six months, not the blended net margin this page shows, and the two must
 * not be conflated. It lives in `notes`, which has no home on the page.
