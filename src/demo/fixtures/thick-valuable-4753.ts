/* Demo fixture: a UK retail/online-arbitrage seller, one month in — AT A LOSS.
 *
 * Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFBA/comments/1vozjjt/ (2026-08-15),
 * "Sellerboard/Tracking profits". The post BODY contains no figures at all —
 * it is a question ("are Amazon fees really that high that I made on loss")
 * attached to one photo of his Sellerboard dashboard card. Every number on
 * this page is transcribed from that photo.
 *
 * ── READ OFF THE SCREENSHOT (i.redd.it/68l0ac66pijh1.jpeg) ────────────────
 * The card is Sellerboard's "Last month" tile, and it reads, verbatim:
 *
 *   Last month · 1-31 July 2026
 *   Sales             £1,451.70
 *   Orders / Units        62 / 65
 *   Refunds                     1
 *   Adv. cost             £0.00
 *   Est. payout       £1,012.23
 *   Net profit          -£29.42
 *
 * Every one of those seven lines was legible at full resolution and none of
 * them is a guess. Currency is £ on the card itself, so GBP — not inferred
 * from the way he writes.
 *
 * ── DERIVED, not read ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   fees   = payout − sales      = 1,012.23 − 1,451.70 = −439.47
 *   COGS   = payout − net profit = 1,012.23 − (−29.42) =  1,041.65
 *   margin = net profit / sales  = −29.42 / 1,451.70   = −2.0266% → −2.0%
 *
 * The identity closes to the penny: 1,451.70 − 439.47 − 1,041.65 = −29.42.
 * `fees` follows the template's convention (payout − sales), so it carries
 * Amazon's fees and the single refund together; ad cost was zero, so nothing
 * of it is hidden in there.
 *
 * ── SCALING: 31 days → 30 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * His period is a whole calendar month, 1–31 July 2026 = 31 days, and these
 * tiles say "last 30 days". Everything is scaled by 30/31 and it is said out
 * loud in `notes`, because "one calendar month" and "measured over 30 days"
 * are different claims even when they are a day apart:
 *
 *   sales      1,451.70 → 1,404.87
 *   orders           62 →       60   (exactly)
 *   units            65 →       63
 *   refunds           1 →        1
 *   ad spend       0.00 →     0.00
 *   net profit   −29.42 →   −28.47
 *   payout     1,012.23 →   979.58
 *   COGS       1,041.65 → 1,008.05
 *   fees        −439.47 →  −425.29
 *
 * ── 🚨 THIS PAGE RENDERS A LOSS, ON PURPOSE ───────────────────────────────
 * −£28.47 profit on £1,404.87 of sales, a −2.0% margin. He is asking Reddit
 * whether his numbers are as bad as they look; the answer is yes, and a demo
 * that quietly rounded him up to a thin profit would be worthless to him and
 * a lie about the one thing this product claims to do. Nothing here is
 * brightened.
 *
 * ── NOT PUBLISHED, so NOT rendered ────────────────────────────────────────
 *   SKU count, brand count, category → null, with the matching `visibility`
 *   flags off. He never stated any of them. An empty tile is honest.
 *   His "£2-5 profit per item" and "15%+ ROI" are his BUYING criteria, not
 *   results, and are recorded in `notes` rather than turned into a figure.
