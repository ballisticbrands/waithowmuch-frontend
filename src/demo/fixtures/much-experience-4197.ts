/* Demo fixture: a first private-label launch, five months in.
 *
 * Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFBA/comments/1vyuh81/ (2026-08-26),
 * "5 months ago, I launched a brand new Amazon private label." The post body
 * states $95,988 sales / 3,383 orders / $15,115 net profit; the Sellerboard
 * card he attached to it carries the same period to the cent, plus units,
 * refunds, ad cost and payout, and is where the extra figures below come from:
 *
 *   Custom range 1 April – 26 August 2026
 *   Sales $95,988.02 · Orders/Units 3,383 / 3,491 · Refunds 142
 *   Adv. cost -$23,238.55 · Est. payout $37,340.44 · Net profit $15,115.19
 *
 * That range is 2026-04-01 → 2026-08-26 = 148 days, not 30. Every 30-day
 * number here is that period scaled by 30/148 — stated because "interpolated
 * from five months" and "measured over 30 days" are different claims, and
 * this page renders the second while meaning the first.
 *
 *   sales      95,988.02 → 19,457.03
 *   orders         3,383 →        686
 *   units          3,491 →        708
 *   refunds          142 →         29
 *   ad spend  −23,238.55 →  −4,710.52
 *   net profit 15,115.19 →   3,063.89
 *   payout     37,340.44 →   7,569.01
 *   COGS = payout − net profit = 37,340.44 − 15,115.19 = 22,225.25 → 4,505.12
 *   margin = net profit / sales = 15,115.19 / 95,988.02 = 15.746…% → 15.7%
 *
 * `fees` follows the template's convention, payout − sales = −58,647.58 (so it
 * carries Amazon's fees, refunds and the ad cost together; ad spend is also
 * broken out on its own line).
 *
 * 🚧 Not published anywhere in the post, so NOT rendered: SKU count, brand
 * count, category. `sku_count: null` renders the SKUs tile as "—", and the
 * three matching `visibility` flags are off. Nothing here is guessed.
 *
 * 🚧 Refunds (142) and est. payout have NO home in the public payload — there
 * is no field for either in PublicProfile — so they are surfaced in `notes`
 * rather than dropped silently.
 *
 * 🚧 The SAME account posted a second, much larger set of figures a day
 * earlier (1vxr3ec: 2023 $2.06M, 2024 $13.47M, 2025 $24.83M, 2026 YTD
 * $14.72M) in the first person PLURAL — "our results" — and his bio says he
 * cofounds an agency. Those are a different scale and arguably a different
 * entity, so they are NOT merged into this profile; they are recorded in
 * `notes` so whoever sends this link knows the other claim exists.
