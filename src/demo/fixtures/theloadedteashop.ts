/**
 * The Loaded Tea Shop — a sourced dossier.
 *
 * Built entirely from public data by the VM-amazon-store-scraping skill
 * (Dragon-marketing/skills/VM-amazon-store-scraping), Phase 2, on 2026-09-07.
 * Nobody at this business has spoken to us.
 *
 * ── The arithmetic ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Revenue is sum(monthlySold x buy box) over the whole 52-ASIN catalogue, and
 * it is a FLOOR twice over:
 *
 *   1. `monthlySold` is Amazon's own "bought in past month" badge, which comes
 *      in brackets. "10,000+" is stored as 10000, so every badged ASIN is
 *      counted at the bottom of its bracket.
 *   2. Amazon only shows the badge above roughly 50/month. 34 of the 52 ASINs
 *      carry no badge and are counted as ZERO. They are not zero; they are
 *      each selling under ~50/month.
 *
 * $1,578,010/mo = 45,050 units at a $35.03 average. See SKILL.md section 4.
 *
 * ── The finding worth the page ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * This brand is not new. It is new TO AMAZON — trading since 2019 on its own
 * Shopify store and Instagram, and only pushing a catalogue onto Amazon from
 * March 2026. Keepa cannot tell you that; a web search can. That gap is the
 * argument for the human review step the skill describes.

  deepDive:
    "The Loaded Tea Shop sells sugar-free, zero-calorie energy drink mix sticks in 40+ flavours, " +
    "packed in 5, 10, 20 and 40 counts. It is a useful business to study because the Amazon " +
    "business and the brand are not the same age. The brand started in a Gulfport, Mississippi " +
    "kitchen in 2019 — founded by ex-Herbalife distributors who decided to make their own " +
    "product — and built its audience on Instagram and its own Shopify store, where it still " +
    "takes about 5,324 visits a month. Amazon came last. Its first listing went up in May 2025, " +
    "but the actual catalogue arrived in a burst between March and May 2026: 15 products in " +
    "roughly eight weeks. Six months on, that catalogue is turning an estimated $1.58M a month, " +
    "of which three multipacks are most of it. So this is not a new brand — it is an " +
    "established direct-to-consumer brand new TO AMAZON, arriving with an audience it already " +
    "had. Keepa cannot tell you that; only looking at the rest of their web presence can, which " +
    "is the argument for a human reading a page like this before it is published. The number " +
    "that does not fit the story is the seller feedback score: 72% over 337 ratings is poor for " +
    "a business this size, and it is the first thing worth asking them about.",
