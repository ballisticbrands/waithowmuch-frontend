/* Demo fixture: the leaderboard, on both of its axes.
 *
 * Payload shape is what `GET /v1/public/leaderboard?by=…&currency=…` returns
 * — the `Board` / `Entry` interfaces at the top of src/pages/Leaderboard.tsx.
 * 🚨 There is no leaderboard client in @ballisticbrands/frontend-shared to
 * check against: the page calls `apiFetch` directly and declares the response
 * type locally. Those two declarations ARE the contract, so an invented field
 * here does not fail a build — it renders as `undefined` or `NaN` and reads
 * like a bug in the page. Keep this file and that interface in step.
 *
 * ── The board IS the demo profiles ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Every row is read out of a demo profile's own payload, by calling the same
 * builder `/demo/<slug>` calls. Nothing is typed out twice, so a row cannot
 * disagree with the page it links to — and a figure corrected in a fixture
 * moves the board with it, in the same commit, without anybody remembering to.
 *
 * That matters more here than anywhere else in the demo set: this board and
 * those profiles get shown to the SAME person, often one click apart, and a
 * leaderboard whose number changes when you click through is a worse
 * advertisement for a verification product than having no leaderboard at all.
 *
 * The two axes are still not two lists. "By business" is one row per business;
 * "by founder" is that same set rolled up per seller by the functions below —
 * a founder whose margin is not the revenue-weighted margin of their own
 * businesses is exactly the arithmetic this product exists to make uncheatable.
 *
 * Deterministic on purpose — no Math.random. A board that reshuffles between
 * two screenshots cannot be reviewed, and cannot be compared with the shot
 * that was sent to someone last week.
 *
 * 🚧 `label` is a PLATFORM, not a brand name ("Amazon FBA"), the same
 * constraint the profile card documents in ../README.md. So sibling rows read
 * alike and `markets` is what tells them apart — which is the real page's
 * behaviour, not a shortcut taken here. The afrasiab demo is the one exception
 * and it predates this file: its twelve businesses carry brand names, which is
 * why the business board reads "Hearthway Home" beside eleven "Amazon FBA"s.
 * Fix it there, not with a special case here.
