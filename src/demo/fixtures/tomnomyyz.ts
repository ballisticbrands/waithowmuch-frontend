/* Demo fixture: a Canadian RA/OA + wholesale seller, first year.
 *
 * Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFBA/comments/1vtt6ah/ (2026-08-20)
 * "Just crossed $50k monthly sales and it has been a little over a year."
 *
 * ── The arithmetic, such as it is ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Unlike the zookeeper fixture there is almost NOTHING to interpolate here.
 * He published a MONTHLY figure, and the page's window is 30 days, so the
 * scaling factor is 1 — his number lands on the tiles unchanged:
 *
 *   revenue (30d)  = 50,000          "just crossed $50k monthly sales"
 *   margin         = 10.0%           the LOW end of his stated "10-15%"
 *   profit  (30d)  = 50,000 × 0.10 = 5,000.00
 *
 * 🚨 THE MARGIN IS A RANGE AND WE TAKE THE BOTTOM OF IT. He wrote "about a
 * 10-15% margin". 12.5% would be the midpoint and 15% would be the flattering
 * read; both would be this page inventing a number he did not publish. A demo
 * whose entire pitch is "these are YOUR figures" cannot round someone's claim
 * upward, so the conservative end is the only defensible choice — and it is
 * said out loud in `notes` so he can see which end we used.
 *
 * ── What he did NOT publish, and is therefore not on this page ────────────
 *   fees, ad spend, COGS  → null. He gave one blended margin and no cost
 *                           breakdown. `revenue − profit` is fees + ads +
 *                           COGS lumped together, NOT cogs, so writing it
 *                           into the cogs field would be a fabrication with
 *                           a plausible shape.
 *   units, orders         → omitted entirely. A wholesale/RA seller's unit
 *                           count cannot be derived from revenue without
 *                           inventing an AOV, and there is no AOV in the post.
 *   SKUs, brands, category→ null / hidden via `visibility`. Never stated.
 *
 * ── The one thing he was ambiguous about ──────────────────────────────────
 * "$50k" — he never says USD or CAD, and he sells only on Amazon.ca. See
 * `notes`; the ambiguity belongs on the page, not buried in a silent choice
 * of currency code here.
