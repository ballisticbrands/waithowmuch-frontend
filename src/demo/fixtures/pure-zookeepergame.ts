/* Demo fixture: a single-business seller.

 * The figures supplied cover 2025-08-01 → 2026-08-23, which is 388 days, not
 * a year. Every 30-day number here is that period scaled by 30/388 — stated
 * because "interpolated from 13 months" and "measured over 30 days" are very
 * different claims, and this page renders the second while meaning the first.
 *
 *   sales      765,478.78 → 59,186.50
 *   orders         69,142 →      5,346
 *   units          73,353 →      5,672
 *   ad spend   −31,416.64 →  −2,429.12
 *   net profit 345,641.32 →  26,724.84
 *   payout     425,290.57 →  32,883.29
 *   COGS = payout − net profit = 79,649.25 → 6,158.45
 *   margin = net profit / sales = 45.15%
 *
 * 🚧 Refunds (959 over the period, ~74 in 30 days) has NO home in the public
 * payload — there is no refunds field anywhere in PublicProfile. It is
 * surfaced in `notes` rather than dropped silently.
