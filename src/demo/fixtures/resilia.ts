/**
 * Resilia Oil Of Oregano — a sourced dossier.
 *
 * Built entirely from public data by the VM-amazon-store-scraping skill
 * (Dragon-marketing/skills/VM-amazon-store-scraping), Phase 2, on 2026-09-07.
 * Nobody at this business has spoken to us.
 *
 * ── The arithmetic ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Revenue is sum(monthlySold x buy box) across the whole 32-ASIN catalogue,
 * and it is a FLOOR twice over, for the same two reasons as every dossier
 * here: `monthlySold` is Amazon's bracketed "bought in past month" badge and
 * is counted at the bottom of its bracket, and the 12 ASINs Amazon shows no
 * badge for are counted as ZERO rather than estimated.
 *
 * $5,658,554/mo = 143,000 units at a $39.57 average, on a catalogue whose
 * first listing went up on 2025-11-27. Ten months, on 32 SKUs.
 *
 * ── The finding worth the page ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * The brief for this dossier said Resilia was the opposite of The Loaded Tea
 * Shop: Amazon-native, no website worth the name. IT IS NOT, and the check
 * that showed it is the whole argument for this page existing.
 *
 * resilia.shop is a live subscription store selling the same three lines, its
 * terms name "Sack Consulting Inc. d/b/a Resilia", it publishes the SAME phone
 * number as the Amazon seller record, and the Wayback Machine has it selling
 * oregano-and-black-seed softgels in August 2024 — fifteen months before the
 * first Amazon listing. Similarweb puts it at 9.9M visits over three months.
 *
 * So the real contrast with The Loaded Tea Shop is not Amazon-native versus
 * DTC-first. Both came to Amazon late. One built an audience — 59.3K Instagram
 * followers, 5,324 visits a month. The other BUYS one, at a scale where the
 * ads run under advertiser pages called "Everyday Wellness Review".

  deepDive:
    "Resilia sells oil of oregano, Ethiopian black seed and odorless aged garlic softgels — three " +
    "supplement lines, 32 ASINs, an estimated $5.66M a month. What makes it worth a page is the " +
    "speed: the first listing went up on 2025-11-27 and the catalogue was turning a ~$68M annual " +
    "run rate inside ten months, with the six aged-garlic SKUs that now lead the business all " +
    "listed on a single day in May 2026. That is not how a brand grows into Amazon; it is how a " +
    "brand that already knows how to sell arrives on it. " +
    "The obvious reading — a new Amazon-native brand with no web presence — is wrong, and this is " +
    "the part a human check adds. resilia.shop is a live subscription store selling the same three " +
    "lines; the Wayback Machine has it selling oregano-and-black-seed softgels in August 2024, " +
    "fifteen months before the first ASIN. Its terms of sale name Sack Consulting Inc. d/b/a " +
    "Resilia, and it publishes the same support number, +1 (203) 516-7743, that sits on the Amazon " +
    "seller record — so the store and the storefront are one business, tied together by two " +
    "documents rather than by an assumption. Similarweb reports 9.9M visits to that store across " +
    "three months to August 2026, up 52.9% month on month. " +
    "The operator reads like a professional one rather than a founder: \"Sack Consulting Inc.\" " +
    "filed the RESILIA trademark ten weeks before the first listing, and the paid acquisition " +
    "behind the DTC store runs through Meta pages named \"Everyday Wellness Review\" and " +
    "\"Vascular Wellness Report\" rather than under the brand. Three geographies attach to the same " +
    "business and nothing public reconciles them: a registered address in Palos Verdes Peninsula, " +
    "California, a Connecticut area code on the phone, and a Miami, Florida address with Florida " +
    "governing law in the store's terms. Each is ordinary on its own. Together they are the first " +
    "thing to ask about. " +
    "The number that does not fit the story is the seller feedback score: 82% over 4,572 ratings " +
    "is poor for a business this size, and on a catalogue this young it is 4,572 ratings' worth of " +
    "something.",

      "Two things here are counted rather than modelled: Meta's ad library returns ~6,900 active US ads mentioning Resilia, and Ubersuggest catches a Google Ads burst peaking at 17 keywords in May 2026. The library is worth opening, because the ads for the biggest line do not run under this brand's name — they run under pages called \"Everyday Wellness Review\" and \"Vascular Wellness Report\". Neither source publishes money, and Amazon publishes nothing at all, so the dollar column is arithmetic of ours: published category click prices and conversion rates against those counts, with the formula in Sources.",

      "For this business it is the larger half. resilia.shop is a subscription store selling the same three lines, live since at least August 2024, and Similarweb reads it at 9.9M visits over three months. Ubersuggest reads 2,120 of those as organic search — so effectively none of it is earned traffic. They rank for their own name and nothing else: \"oil of oregano\" runs 135,000 US searches a month and resilia.shop is nowhere on it.",
