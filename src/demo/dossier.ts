/**
 * A SOURCED DOSSIER — what we can learn about a seller who has never heard of

 * 🚧 The product has no such page. This is the second use of the case
 * src/demo/README.md reserves for a feature that does not exist yet (the first
 * is `group`), and like that one it has no real page it could drift from.
 *
 * ── Why a figure cannot exist here without a source ──────────────────────
 * On a site called WaitHowMuch, a number with no stated origin is the
 * exact thing the product argues against. So `Figure.source` is REQUIRED and
 * is an id into `Dossier.sources`: adding a figure without registering where
 * it came from does not type-check. That is deliberate — it is the one
 * invariant worth spending the type system on, because the failure mode is a
 * page that looks authoritative and cannot be checked.
 *
 * None of this is verified. Every figure here is modelled or read off someone
 * else's public page, which is why the dossier renders at the bottom rung of
 * the ladder (BRANDING.md section 5) and says so above the numbers, not in a
 * footnote.
 */

/**
 * 🚨 THE ID EVERY INVENTED FIGURE CITES.
 *
 * Whole tabs of this demo (sourcing, advertising, keyword ranks) show numbers
 * NOBODY MEASURED — they exist to show what the page would look like once the
 * pipelines behind them are built. On a product whose entire claim is that its
 * figures mean something exactly, an invented number that loses its marker is
 * the worst bug this page could have.
 *
 * So invention is not a loose asterisk typed beside a value; it is a SOURCE
 * like any other. `source: INVENTED` renders "*" instead of a footnote number,
 * and that marker links to a bibliography entry that says, in as many words,
 * that we made it up. A figure therefore cannot be invented and unmarked
 * without someone deleting its source — which does not type-check, because
 * `source` is required.

 * 🚨 THE THIRD RUNG: computed by us, from figures somebody else published.

 * card, a category CPC benchmark and a conversion-rate benchmark are all
 * published, and multiplying them is arithmetic a reader can check and
 * disagree with.
 *
 * Collapsing that into either neighbour loses something. Call it measured and
 * we are claiming a source we do not have; call it invented and we are
 * throwing away the fact that every input is cited and the formula is on the

 * entry that states the formula and names the numbered sources that feed it.
