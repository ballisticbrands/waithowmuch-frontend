/**
 * ONE business, at waithowmuch.com/business/<slug>.
 *
 * 🚨 PUBLIC. No auth guard, and there must never be one: this is a share
 * target — a seller posting one brand's numbers has nowhere else to point
 * that is not their whole portfolio — so it has to render identically for a
 * signed-out visitor, a crawler and an AI assistant.
 * scripts/build-businesses.mjs bakes a static copy of each published one at
 * build time for exactly that reason.
 *
 * ── The name is the URL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * "Amazon FBA 48213", derived by the backend from the opaque slug. The real
 * account name is never published — profiles render a blurred "Stealth
 * Brand" and this page must not become the hole in that — and an opaque
 * identifier means the page needs no private data to have a heading, a title
 * and a share card. A seller-controlled name toggle stays possible later
 * without changing a single URL.
 *
 * ── Why "not live yet" is a state, and why it is owner-only ──────────────
 * The backend answers ONE 404 for five different reasons (never published,
 * never claimed, no rows yet, an Ads slug, a slug nobody was issued) because
 * the difference is an existence oracle. That is right for a stranger and
 * useless for the person who just finished the add-business wizard and
 * landed here minutes before their first sync completes. So ownership is
 * resolved the same way the profile page resolves it — from the caller's OWN
 * `GET /v1/profiles` and that profile's OWN connection list, both of which
 * return only their own rows — and nothing here can be used to discover that
 * somebody else's business exists.

              <h3>Sales — Amazon&rsquo;s own &ldquo;bought in past month&rdquo;</h3>
              <p>
                Amazon prints a badge on a listing that reads &ldquo;300+ bought in
                the past month&rdquo;. It is the only sales figure Amazon publishes,
                and{" "}
                <a href="https://keepa.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">
                  Keepa
                </a>{" "}
                records it for every product, every time it changes. We read it
                across all {p.metrics.sku_count ?? "the seller's"} listings and
                multiplied by the buy box price.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two things make this a <strong>floor rather than a guess</strong>.
                The badge is bucketed, so &ldquo;300+&rdquo; is recorded as 300 when
                the truth is somewhere under 400. And Amazon only shows it above
                roughly 50 sales a month — listings below that show nothing and are
                counted here as zero. The real figure is higher than the one above,
                not lower.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because Keepa keeps the <em>history</em> of that badge, these
                figures are a trailing twelve months rather than this month
                multiplied by twelve. That matters more than it sounds: December
                runs about 3.8&times; June for this business, so a September
                snapshot annualised would understate it by roughly two thirds.
              </p>

              <h3>Cost of goods — quoted, not known</h3>
              <p>
                The seller has not told us what their product costs, so we price it
                the way a buyer would: a manufacturing quote and a freight quote.
                We assume <strong>$2.70 to manufacture</strong> and{" "}
                <strong>$1.00 to ship</strong> each unit into Amazon&rsquo;s
                warehouse.

                🚨 This is the weakest number on the page and the one a real margin
                depends on. Amazon&rsquo;s own fees are not estimated — the referral
                percentage and the FBA fee are published per listing — but the cost
                of the product is a quote, and quotes move with order size,
                materials and season.
              </p>

              <h3>What would replace all of this</h3>
              <p>
                One thing: the seller connecting their Amazon account. Then revenue
                and fees come from Amazon directly and cost of goods comes from
                them, and the badge above stops saying &ldquo;Estimated&rdquo;.
