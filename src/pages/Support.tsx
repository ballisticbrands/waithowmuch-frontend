/**
 * Public "how do I get help" page.
 *
 * Deliberately answers the questions this product actually generates rather
 * than a generic help-desk shell: there are no passwords here, a profile is
 * invisible until it is published, and the username change limit's own error
 * string tells the seller to "contact support" — until this page existed that
 * sentence pointed nowhere (backend src/services/profiles/service.ts,
 * USERNAME_CHANGE_LIMIT).
 *
 * ⚠️ The two lists below are a claim about what the product can do TODAY, and
 * they were written against the settings page, not from memory. As of
 * 2026-08-26 `ProfileSettings.tsx` in frontend-shared has publish/re-publish
 * but **no unpublish control** (deliberate — see the comment above
 * `setPublished`), and **no disconnect control** for a connected account: the
 * checkbox beside an account only chooses whether it appears on the profile.
 * Nothing in the app deletes an account either. Everything in that state is
 * listed here as "email us", which is the honest answer while it is true.
 * Ship a self-serve control and move the line up in the same change.
 *
 * ⚠️ No response-time promise on this page, on purpose. About.tsx and
 * Privacy.tsx are written on the rule that a written promise we are failing is
 * worse than no page at all, and an SLA is the easiest one to break. Add one
 * only when somebody owns it.
 *
 * The address comes from `brand.supportEmail` — one value, shared with About,
 * Privacy and Terms, so a change of inbox is a one-line change in
 * src/brands/waithowmuch.ts.
 *
 * 🚨 Also in PUBLIC_PAGES (src/data/site.mjs) so the build emits a static stub
 * and GitHub Pages answers 200 rather than the 404.html bounce, and in the
 * backend's RESERVED_USERNAMES so no seller can claim the handle "support"
 * and shadow this page through the /:username catch-all. ("support" was
 * already reserved before this page shipped.)

            An emailed link is good for 15 minutes and works once. If yours has

          <p className="mt-2">
            After you connect Amazon, the first sync has to finish before there
            is anything to compute from, so a brand-new connection shows nothing

            Everything on a profile is computed from the reports Amazon gives us

            your account has synced, email us the profile URL and the number you
            expected, and we will trace it back to the report it came from.

            is not what it claims to be, email us the profile URL and what looks
            wrong. Verified figures come from the seller's own Amazon account
            and a connected social account can verify only one profile, which is
            what makes impersonation hard — but if something got through, we
            want to know.
