/**
 * /demo/<slug> for a SOURCED DOSSIER — everything public about a seller who
 * has never heard of us, with every figure naming where it came from.
 *
 * 🚧 The product has no such page, so — like `group` — there is no real page
 * this could drift from, and src/demo/README.md's third-kind rule applies.
 *
 * ── Shaped like /business/<slug> ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Same wrapper (`vm-profile`), same header, the shared StatTile row, the
 * shared TrendChart, the same `Business deep-dive` block. Reusing those rather
 * than restyling them is what stops the two drifting. `.vm-dossier` adds only
 * what a business page has no equivalent for: tabs, the timeline, source
 * markers and the bibliography.
 *
 * ── Why tabs, and why the tab is in the URL ──────────────────────────────
 * Eight subjects, most of which a given reader does not want. As one column it
 * ran past 4,500px and the sources — the part that makes the rest defensible —
 * were below everything. `?tab=` rather than component state so a tab can be
 * SENT: the bibliography is the natural end of any argument about a figure, and
 * "look at the sources" has to be a link. Same idiom as Leaderboard's `?by=`,
 * including `replace: true` — a tab is not a navigation, and pushing would make
 * Back walk a reader through their own tab presses.
 *
 * ── Nothing here is verified ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Bottom rung, drawn by the SHARED badge. And three tabs are openly INVENTED —
 * every figure on them carries a "*" that links to the bibliography entry
 * admitting it. See the note on INVENTED in @/demo/dossier.

            Amazon publishes no search volumes and localises its search results to whoever is
            looking, so a scraped keyword position is worth less than it looks. Best-seller rank is
            printed on the listing itself, is the same number for everyone, and is what a seller in
            this category actually watches.

      <h2>How these estimates were made</h2>

      <h3>Nobody has asserted these figures</h3>
      <p>
        Not Amazon, not the seller — nobody at this business has spoken to us. So every number here
        carries a marker saying where it came from, and there are three kinds. A{" "}
        <strong>number</strong> means somebody published it and we read it: Amazon's own fee rates,
        a supplier's own price list, a best-seller rank printed on the listing, a keyword tool's
        volume. A <span data-invented-star="">≈</span> means we computed it from those, and the
        formula is in{" "}
        <button type="button" data-linklike="" onClick={() => go("sources")}>
          Sources
        </button>{" "}
        — ad spend and the margin are the two that matter. A <span data-invented-star="">*</span>{" "}
        means we made it up, and on this page it is down to one row: the freight and duty nobody
        quoted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The distinction is the point. A figure you can reproduce from the sources listed is a figure
        you can argue with — and being argued with is the outcome this page is built for. A figure
        you would have to take our word for is marked so you do not.
      </p>

      <h3>Sales — Amazon's own "bought in past month"</h3>
      <p>
        Amazon prints a badge on a listing that reads "10,000+ bought in the past month". It is the
        only sales figure Amazon publishes, and{" "}
        <a href="https://keepa.com/#!api" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">
          Keepa
        </a>{" "}
        records it. We read it across all {d.counts.catalogue} listings and multiplied by the buy
        box price.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two things make this a <strong>floor rather than a guess</strong>. The badge is bucketed, so
        "10,000+" is recorded as 10,000 when the truth is somewhere under 20,000. And Amazon only
        shows it above roughly 50 sales a month — the {d.counts.unbadged} listings below that
        threshold show nothing and are counted here as zero. The real figure is higher than the one
        above, not lower.
      </p>

      <h3>The operator, and where they are</h3>
      <p>
        A brand and the business running it are not the same record. We resolve the buy-box seller
        on the top listings, then read that seller's own registration — legal name, address, country
        and feedback score. Amazon publishes it; we did not model it.

            The line stops where Keepa's badge history does. Amazon only shows the badge above
            roughly 50 sales a month, so the months before it are absent rather than zero — a gap
            in the line is a month nobody measured, not a month of no sales.
