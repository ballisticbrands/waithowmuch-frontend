/**
 * Profile settings — the one screen that actually edits the product.
 *
 * ⚠️ DELIBERATELY PLAIN, like everything else here. The form itself lives in
 * @ballisticbrands/frontend-shared as unstyled HTML elements; this file only
 * resolves WHICH profile to edit and wraps it in the app's chrome. When real
 * branding lands, style the shared component (or fork it there, not here) so
 * every brand app gets the same behaviour.
 *
 * ⚠️ THERE IS NO CREATE FALLBACK HERE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. This screen used
 * to call createProfile({}) when the list came back empty, as a recovery path
 * for a fire-and-forget backend create. It was not recovering an edge case: it
 * was quietly carrying the entire Google signup flow, which never created a
 * profile at all. Because the repair was silent, nobody noticed for weeks — and
 * a seller who signed up, landed on the dashboard and left still had no page,
 * because the fallback only ran if they happened to open settings.
 *
 * Every WaitHowMuch signup now creates the profile in the same transaction
 * as the account (backend: src/services/auth/provision.ts), so an empty list
 * here means something is genuinely broken and we say so instead of papering
 * over it. POST /v1/profiles still exists — a user may legitimately want a
 * second profile — it just stops being something this page calls behind their
 * back. See skills/feature-dev/…/FEATURE_VM_2026-08-24_profile-on-every-signup-path §4.
