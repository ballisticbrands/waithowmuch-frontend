/**
 * /demo/g/<slug> — a GROUP board: one coach or agency and their people,
 * ranked, on one page.
 *
 * 🚧 The product has no groups. Every other demo renders a real page against
 * fixture data; this one shows a feature that does not exist, which is the
 * case src/demo/README.md reserves a third kind for.
 *
 * It is still the REAL `<Leaderboard>` underneath — the board a group needs is
 * the board the product already has, pointed at a subset — so what a prospect
 * sees is the shipped component and not a mockup that would drift from it. The
 * only demo-only part is the header above it, and that rides in through
 * `banner`, the prop that exists precisely because Leaderboard renders its own
 * Shell and anything wrapped around it lands beside the nav rail.
