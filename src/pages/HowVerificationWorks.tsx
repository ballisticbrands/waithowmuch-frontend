/**
 * The trust page. What a badge means, how you earn one, and what each route costs.
 *
 * This is the page the whole product rests on: every other screen shows a
 * number, and this is the only one that explains why a stranger should believe
 * it. A reader who lands here is deciding whether the site is worth anything.
 *
 * 🚨 THREE TWINS THIS PAGE MUST NOT DRIFT FROM. All three are trust copy, and
 * a page that describes verification differently from the code that performs
 * it is worse than no page — it is a written promise we are failing.
 *
 *   1. `sellerconnect/src/services/profiles/verification.ts` — the tiers, the
 *      labels and the one-sentence descriptions are DERIVED there and shipped
 *      in the API payload. The strings quoted below in TIERS are that file's
 *      LABELS map. When it changes, this changes.
 *   2. `src/components/AddBusinessModal.tsx` — its METHODS array is the same
 *      three routes, described to someone mid-signup. The prices, the
 *      "what we cannot do" list and the report instructions are duplicated
 *      here on purpose (the modal does not export them) and must stay in
 *      step — including the Sales Dashboard URL, which a seller follows
 *      literally. 🚧 The honest fix is one shared constant both import;
 *      until somebody does that, edit both.
 *   3. `frontend-shared/src/pages/PublicProfile.tsx` — `BusinessCard` renders
 *      the badge. `Badge` below reproduces its exact conditional (a tier that
 *      startsWith "verified" gets ✓ and the green fill, everything else gets
 *      ○ and red type), because a specimen that does not match the thing it
 *      is a specimen OF teaches the reader the wrong badge.
 *
 * 🚧 THE PAGE IS AHEAD OF THE FLOW IN TWO PLACES, both marked in the copy:
 *   • The $20 upgrade from ◑ Verified revenue to ✓ Verified margins is the
 *     designed model. Nothing charges $20 or takes a COGS sheet today — the
 *     modal's connect route is Free and stops there.
 *   • SELLERBOARD IS HIDDEN, not gone. It was a selectable "Coming soon"
 *     option the flow then refused, which promises worse than not offering
 *     it. Its column and section are commented out below, and its METHODS
 *     entry is commented out in AddBusinessModal.tsx — restore both together
 *     when the integration exists.
 *
 * 🚨 In PUBLIC_PAGES (src/data/site.mjs), not APP_ROUTES: this page is meant
 * to be crawled — it answers the query someone types before they trust us —
 * and APP_ROUTES becomes a `Disallow:`. "how-verification-works" is already in
 * the backend's RESERVED_USERNAMES, so the /:username catch-all cannot shadow
 * it.

/**
 * The window the hero's chart illustrates: the twelve COMPLETE months ending
 * with last month. In August 2026 that is Aug 2025 → Jul 2026.
 *
 * 🚨 COMPUTED, NEVER WRITTEN DOWN. These were two hardcoded strings, which
 * meant the one picture on the page arguing "this figure is current" would
 * quietly start advertising a stale year — on the page whose entire subject is
 * whether our numbers can be trusted. A wrong date here is not a cosmetic bug.
 *
 * The CURRENT month is deliberately excluded. A partial month is a shorter
 * month, so including it would draw a cliff at the right edge of a chart whose
 * whole job is to look like a healthy business — and it is the same
 * complete-windows convention the real profile pages use.
 *
 * Runs in the browser on every render, so it cannot go stale in the build
 * output: the static stub for this route is an empty shell and the page is
 * client-rendered. `new Date(y, m - 1, 1)` handles the underflow — month −1 is
 * December of the previous year — so no wrap-around arithmetic is needed here.

/**
 * The hero: a claim nobody can check, beside a number anyone can.
 *
 * 🚨 COLOUR DISCIPLINE, both directions (BRANDING.md §3, §3.1).
 *
 *   Green means VERIFIED and is not spent anywhere else, so the ✓ badge on the
 *   right has to stay the loudest thing here. Nothing on this page may put a
 *   second green next to it.
 *
 *   Red is ERRORS ONLY — §4.3 is explicit that a thin margin is not an error
 *   and never renders red. A fabricated claim IS a falsehood rather than a bad
 *   number, so red is honest here, but it is rationed to the ✗ mark and one
 *   word. As a panel fill it would out-shout the green and turn the rule off.
 *
 * The left panel is a silhouette on purpose. A rendered face would be a person,
 * and a person who resembles an identifiable real seller is a defamation
 * problem on a page whose entire subject is who is lying about their numbers.
 * No face, no name, no logo.
 *
 * The right panel is not a drawing of the product — the badge is the real
 * `.vm-badge` and the figures are real `--font-mono`, so it cannot drift from
 * what a profile actually renders. Same reason §2's specimens are real.

            A profile's badge is not a score out of ten. It is the name of a cell in a
            two-by-two: <strong>where the revenue came from</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>where the cost of goods came from</strong>. Those are separate questions, and
            they are answered by separate evidence.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Keeping them separate is the point. A seller with real Amazon revenue and a
            cost percentage they guessed has verified <em>revenue</em> and a{" "}
            <em>modelled</em> margin — and a strong signal on one axis must never be allowed to
            launder a weak one on the other. So the badge names what was checked, and the line
            underneath it names what was not.

            The two badges differ in three channels at once — the <strong>glyph</strong>{" "}
            fills in (◑ → ✓), the <strong>word</strong> changes, and the{" "}
            <strong>colour</strong> steps amber → green. Any one of the three tells you which
            you are looking at, which is the point: most people meet this product as a
            screenshot, and a distinction carried by colour alone is invisible in greyscale and
            to a colour-blind reader.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            The amber badge is the one that matters most, because it is the easiest to overclaim.
            Revenue really did come from Amazon — that half is checked, and the badge says so
            rather than withholding credit. But the costs behind the margin are a number the
            seller supplied and we did not open, so the badge stops short of green and the line
            beneath it says exactly where it stopped.

            Verification is per connected business, so the badge sits on the business card rather
            than beside the seller's name. Someone running a connected Amazon account and a second
            business they typed in carries both badges on the same page, side by side — rolling
            them into one would either flatter the typed-in half or malign the connected one.

          <p className="mt-2">
            The header count says <em>“n businesses with verified revenue”</em> for the same
            reason: “3 businesses” is a claim a reader cannot do anything with.

            You go through Amazon's own consent screen and grant three read-only roles: Finance and
            Accounting, Selling Partner Insights, and Inventory and Order Tracking. We pull the
            order, settlement, advertising and inventory reports Amazon provides, compute the
            aggregate figures, and publish only those. Nothing is typed in and nothing is taken on
            our word. You can revoke it at Amazon, or disconnect here, at any time.

          <p className="mt-3">
            This earns <Badge tier="verified_revenue" label="Verified revenue" />. Your margin still
            rests on a blended cost percentage you supply, so it is published as modelled. To turn
            it into <Badge tier="verified_margin" label="Verified margins" /> you send a per-SKU cost
            sheet and spend fifteen minutes on a call while we check it against what Amazon is

          <p className="mt-3">
            <strong>The advantage of connecting is that it does not stop.</strong> Verification is

            You screenshot one report out of Seller Central and send it to us. It is the
            hardest thing on Amazon to fabricate — twelve months of daily sales and traffic
            that all has to hang together — which is exactly why it is the one we ask for. We

            That earns <Badge tier="verified_revenue" label="Verified revenue" />. It cannot

            <strong>that report contains no cost data</strong>. It can evidence what you sold
            and never what it cost you, so your margin stays a number you supplied. The same
            fifteen-minute call turns it into{" "}

          <p className="mt-3">
            The trade against connecting is freshness. One report covers one window and does
            not refresh itself, so a profile that keeps up to date on its own means connecting
            an account instead.
