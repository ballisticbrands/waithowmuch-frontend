 * Public privacy policy. Linked from the footer of every page — that link was

 * ⚠️ PLAIN-LANGUAGE AND DESCRIPTIVE, not boilerplate. Every claim below is
 * meant to be true of what the product actually does, because a privacy policy
 * that describes a different product is worse than none: it is a written
 * promise we would be failing. If the product's data handling changes, this
 * page changes in the same commit.
 *
 * 🚨 The "what we publish" section is the load-bearing one. It states the same
 * boundary the backend enforces and tests
 * (src/routes/public-profile-privacy.http.test.ts asserts a closed field set),
 * so the promise here and the code cannot drift apart quietly.
 *
 * NOT legal advice and not reviewed by counsel — see the note rendered at the
 * top of the page.

            publishes only those figures. We do not publish your store name,
            your brands, your products, your ASINs, your suppliers or your

            <li>
              <strong>Account details.</strong> Your email address, and — if you
              sign in with Google — the name and profile picture Google provides.
              We never receive or store your Google password.

            <li>
              <strong>Amazon selling data</strong>, if you choose to connect an
              Amazon account. We receive order, settlement, advertising and
              inventory reports through Amazon's official APIs, using access you
              grant and can revoke at any time from Amazon.

              <strong>Basic technical data</strong> needed to run and secure the

          <h2 className="text-base font-semibold">What we publish</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            A published profile shows aggregate financial metrics — revenue,
            profit and margin over a period — together with whatever you chose to
            write about yourself, your handle and your picture. Nothing else from
            your Amazon account is published.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            <strong>Your profile is not public until you publish it.</strong>{" "}
            Creating an account and connecting Amazon publishes nothing. You
            choose what to publish and you can unpublish at any time.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 opacity-80">
            Two things worth stating plainly, because they are exceptions: broad{" "}
            <em>category</em> names may appear on a profile, and a profile we
            created from public information before you claimed it may show the
            business name that information came from.

          <h2 className="text-base font-semibold">Why we're allowed to use it</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            To provide the service you asked for, to keep it secure, and to meet
            our legal obligations. Where we rely on your consent — connecting an
            Amazon account, publishing a profile — you can withdraw it by
            disconnecting or unpublishing.

            Only the service providers needed to run the product: cloud hosting
            and data storage (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud), email delivery
            for sign-in links, and Amazon and Google themselves for the
            connections and sign-in you initiate. We do not sell or rent personal
            data, and we do not share it for advertising.

          <h2 className="text-base font-semibold">How long we keep it</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            For as long as your account exists. Delete your account and we delete
            your profile and personal data; disconnect an Amazon account and we
            stop receiving new data from it. Backups and legally required records
            may persist for a limited period after deletion.
