 * colour and aesthetics are a later pass.
 *
 * 🚨 The wordmark is ONE text node on purpose. Every Dragon frontend renders its
 * name split across two elements so a gradient can hit the second half —
 * `Dragon<span className="…bg-clip-text…">Reply</span>` — which makes the brand
 * name invisible to `grep` while still reading as the brand name in the DOM.
 * That is how an inherited parent brand shipped in the header of every page on
 * dragonrestock-frontend. When real branding lands, keep it a single node.

   * The X.com model the operator asked for is that the nav takes you to your
   * OWN public page — the thing other people see — and the edit affordance
   * lives ON it. But WHICH page that is takes a round trip to answer, so this
   * header used to compute the href: it seeded the link at "/settings" and
   * replaced it when `listProfiles()` came back.
   *
   * 🚨 A computed href is a guess, and it was wrong in two ordinary
   * situations, both of which reached the operator as "the Profile link still
   * goes to /settings" on a bundle that had the fix in it:
   *
   *   1. Click before the round trip finishes and you follow the placeholder.
   *   2. A failed lookup fell back to "/settings" silently, which is
   *      indistinguishable from "nothing is published" — and from the bug.
   *
   * So the header no longer knows. /profile resolves the destination when it
   * is opened (src/pages/ProfileRedirect.tsx), which cannot be stale and has
   * somewhere to SHOW a failure. It also drops a duplicate listProfiles()
   * call: on a profile page this header and the page itself were each asking.
   *
   * "profile" is in the backend's RESERVED_USERNAMES, so no seller's handle
   * can shadow it. */
