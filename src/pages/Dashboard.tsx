 * Placeholder dashboard.

 * 🚨 NO VerifyEmailBanner here, deliberately. WaitHowMuch has exactly two
 * ways in and both prove the address before a session exists: Google (Google
 * asserts the email) and a magic link (the click proves inbox possession, and
 * /magic-login stamps emailVerifiedAt). There is no password path, so there is
 * no unverified-but-signed-in state to nag about — a banner here can only ever
 * be wrong. It was also rendering unconditionally on `user?.email` rather than
 * on the verification flag, so verified users saw it forever.
 *
 * ⚠️ Still deliberately plain, but no longer empty: the backend profile models,
 * brand.ts row and CORS entry have landed, so /settings is a real screen that
 * edits a real profile. This screen's remaining jobs are to be the post-signup
 * destination so the funnel events fire against something genuine, and to host
 * the connection reconcile below.
