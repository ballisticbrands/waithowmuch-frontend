/**
 * 🚧 A REDESIGN of /business/<slug>, shown at /demo/<slug>.
 *
 * ── Why this one demo reimplements a layout ──────────────────────────────
 * Every other demo in this repo mounts the REAL page and answers its fetch,
 * precisely so a demo can never drift from production (src/demo/README.md).
 * This one cannot: the whole point of it is to look DIFFERENT from the page
 * we ship, so there is nothing to drift from. README reserves exactly this
 * case — "a further kind is a case in Demo.tsx and a component beside it".
 *
 * The cost is real and worth naming: when Business.tsx changes, this does not
 * follow. That is acceptable only while this is a PROPOSAL. The moment it is
 * accepted, the sections below move into Business.tsx and this file is
 * deleted — it must never become a second business page we maintain.
 *
 * ── It takes a payload; it does not fetch ────────────────────────────────
 * `useDemoFetch` exists because the real pages fetch and take no data prop.
 * This component is new, so it can simply take the payload — which also means
 * the sections below are already shaped to consume the production response,
 * and graduating them is a swap of the source, not a rewrite.
 *
 * ── Provenance is the one rule inherited whole ───────────────────────────
 * 🚨 `facts.derived` was read from Amazon; `facts.declared` was typed by the
 * seller. This page renders them in separate blocks under separate legends,
 * and NOTHING declared may wear --verified green — on a verification product,
 * green on an unverified claim is the site vouching for something it never
 * saw. See the `tone` note in src/demo/registry.ts.

 * Profit drawn INSIDE revenue makes the pale remainder read as cost, which is
 * elegant and answers the wrong question. A buyer comparing listings is
 * reading two magnitudes against one scale and against each OTHER over time;
 * nesting makes profit's own trajectory hard to trace, because its baseline
 * moves with revenue. Side by side on one axis, both series are readable and
 * the dashed fits say which way each is going.
 *

 * 🚨 Revenue and profit share a scale and must keep sharing it. A second
 * y-axis would let profit's line be drawn as tall as revenue's and make a 44%
 * margin look like a 100% one — the single most misleading thing a chart of
 * this shape can do.
 *
 * ── Periods are SLICES, never separate fetches ───────────────────────────

 * should not have to learn a second vocabulary here. What they do NOT do is

 * 🚨 COGS. The broker definition asserts what is inside the number —
 * procurement, labour, materials, fulfilment and storage fees, freight,
 * duties. We cannot assert that, because this figure is a SINGLE BLENDED
 * PERCENTAGE the seller typed (`Connection.blendedCogsPct`, with zero
 * CogsEntry rows behind it). What it includes is exactly what that seller
 * decided it includes, and nobody has checked. The tooltip says so; borrowing
 * the confident version would launder a claim into a definition.
 *
 * 🚨 The banded metrics each explain the band, because a reader who is not
 * told "250+" is a bracket will read it as a number that happens to be round.
