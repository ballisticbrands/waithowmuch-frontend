 * The leaderboard, rendered against fixture data.
 *
 * Deliberately thin: it is the REAL `<Leaderboard>` below, with its own Shell,
 * its own tabs and its own fetch — this only answers that fetch. The tab
 * switch keeps working because the responder reads `by` off the URL every
 * time, so "By founder" / "By business" exercise the same code path they do in
 * production rather than a demo-only toggle.
 *
 * Why this demo exists: `/leaderboard` in production shows the layout against
 * however few sellers have published a margin so far, which demonstrates the
 * page but not the argument. This is the same page with a board on it.
