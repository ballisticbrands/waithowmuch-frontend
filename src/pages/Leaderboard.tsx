/**
 * 🚧 HARD-CODED BOARD ROWS — a GTM trial, not a data model.
 *
 * ── Why these are not in the database ────────────────────────────────────
 * They cannot be. The backend excludes estimated figures from the board on
 * purpose: `RANKABLE_TIERS` in src/services/profiles/leaderboard.ts is
 * `["verified_revenue", "verified_margin"]`, and the orphan loop `continue`s
 * past anything else — so a Keepa-modelled business is dropped before it
 * becomes an entry, however it is published. The argument for that rule is
 * good (an unaudited estimate should not sit in the same rank order as figures
 * somebody checked) and reversing it is a product decision, not a patch.
 *
 * So this is deliberately the cheap version: a published dossier appears on the
 * board to find out whether the page earns traffic at all. If it does, the
 * clean fix is a backend change — either a tier that ranks estimates
 * separately or an explicit "sourced" section in the API response — and these
 * rows come straight back out.
 *
 * ── What keeps it honest in the meantime ─────────────────────────────────
 *   • `rank: null`. It renders as "—" and carries `data-unranked`, which is
 *     the component's existing meaning: listed, not placed. It never takes a
 *     number off a verified business, and it never competes for one.
 *   • The badge says `estimated`, the same as the page it links to.
 *   • It appends AFTER the API's entries, so it cannot reorder them.
 *   • Business mode only. There is no founder behind a sourced dossier, so a
 *     founder board has nothing to show for it.
 *
 * ⚠️ The figures are copied from src/dossiers/spitehouse.ts and will go stale
 * if that fixture changes. They are USD; the row renders its own currency, so
 * it stays labelled correctly when a reader switches the top bar.
