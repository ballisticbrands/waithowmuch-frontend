/**
 * A seller profile at waithowmuch.com/<username>.
 *
 * 🚨 PUBLIC. No auth guard, and there must never be one — this is the page the
 * whole product exists to produce, and it has to render for a signed-out
 * visitor, a crawler and an AI assistant identically. scripts/build-profiles.mjs
 * bakes a static copy of each one at build time for exactly that reason.
 *
 * ── If you own it, this page IS the editor (the x.com model) ──────────────
 * Ownership is resolved HERE, in the host, because it is SESSION knowledge and
 * the shared renderer is deliberately session-free — it takes the answer, not
 * the question. The mapping username → profile id comes from the caller's OWN
 * `GET /v1/profiles`, which returns only their own profiles, so nothing here
 * can be used to discover that somebody else's handle exists. With `owner`
 * set, the shared page reads `GET /v1/profiles/:id/preview` (the same builder
 * as the public endpoint, so the owner and the world cannot end up looking at
 * different pages) and turns the fields the payload already carries into
 * inputs, in place.
 *
 * /settings is not going anywhere: the username, the picture, connected
 * accounts and publishing still live there, and the owner bar links to it.
