 * second place to forget. A demo that exists but is not linked from anywhere
 * is a demo nobody remembers to send — which is why hiding one takes an
 * explicit `unlisted: true` on the entry rather than an edit here.
 *
 * Carries the same banner and noindex as the demos themselves: this page
 * enumerates pages that must not be crawled, so it must not be a crawlable
 * index OF them. `/demo` is in DEMO_PAGES for exactly that reason.
